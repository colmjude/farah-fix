It's made from a super fine 28-wale baby cord, which means it has a much finer texture than standard corduroy and extremely soft to the touch. This makes it a perfect transitional piece for early autumn, giving you a warm feel with more body than a standard oxford shirt without being too heavy for layering.

If You're Caught Between Two Sizes Or Prefer A More Regular Fit, We Recommend Sizing Up. Composition And Care 100% Organic Cotton 28 Wale Baby Cord Fabrication Machine Wash "
